  <p>
    The Gatsby Blog is a statically-generated site built with GatsbyJS.

Resources served on the blog are fetched from [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/) using GraphQL. 


The primary advantages of using a statically generated site with Gatsby include the SEO friendly nature of a static site, the exceptionally fast routing, and of particular note, the Gatsby Developer ecosystem, which has a wide range of plugins to facilitate a vast array of technologies.

Gatsby's modular nature makes it a perfect solution for a small business such as a shop; the Shopify plugin, for example, might allow such a business to quickly set up their online store, and modify the data from whichever CMS they prefer, and easily switch to another CMS if ever they choose to migrate, just by switching the plugin to that of their new source of data.
